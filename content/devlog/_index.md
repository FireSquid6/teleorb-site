# Devlog

This is where all of the devlogs posted by Jonathan Deiss (FireSquid) go. He (hopefully) posts one once per week on Sunday summarizing the week's changes and new additions. This chapter goes by inverse chronological order, so scroll down to the bottom if you want to read all of the devlogs.
